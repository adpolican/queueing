The following configuration converges to stable behavior

NAMES = 'a b c d e'.split()
ARRIVAL_RATES = dict(zip(NAMES, [100, 200, 75, 300, 30]))
SERVICE_TIMES = dict(zip(NAMES, [1, 1, 2, 1, 10]))

TOTAL_SERVERS = 1070
TIME_STEPS = 100

DECREASE_COEF = 0.9
INCREASE_CONST = 1

STARTING_SHARES = 1

But lowering TOTAL_SERVERS to 1050 causes it diverge instead.
This illustrates the need for a good scheduling algorithm.
